# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical user interaction flaws in the SQLite file browser built with GPUI. After analyzing the codebase, several interaction issues have been identified that impact the user experience, including problems with page selection, file watching, error handling, and overall UI responsiveness. This specification will systematically address these issues to create a more robust and user-friendly SQLite browser.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Page Selection and Interaction

**User Story:** As a user browsing SQLite database pages, I want reliable page selection and visual feedback, so that I can easily navigate and inspect different pages without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a page square in the grid THEN the system SHALL immediately highlight the selected page with a clear visual indicator
2. WHEN a page is selected THEN the sidebar SHALL update to show the correct page details within 100ms
3. WHEN a user clicks on an already selected page THEN the system SHALL maintain the selection state without flickering
4. WHEN hovering over page squares THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback with smooth opacity transitions
5. IF a page fails to load details THEN the system SHALL display a clear error message in the sidebar instead of showing stale data

### Requirement 2: File Operations and Error Handling

**User Story:** As a user opening SQLite database files, I want robust file handling with clear error messages, so that I can understand what went wrong and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user attempts to open an invalid SQLite file THEN the system SHALL display a specific error message explaining the issue
2. WHEN a file operation fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages with suggested solutions
3. WHEN opening a file that doesn't exist THEN the system SHALL automatically show the file dialog instead of showing a generic error
4. WHEN a file is corrupted or partially readable THEN the system SHALL load available pages and warn about parsing failures
5. IF the file dialog is cancelled THEN the system SHALL return to the previous state gracefully without showing error messages

### Requirement 3: File Watching and Live Updates

**User Story:** As a developer working with SQLite databases, I want the browser to automatically refresh when the database file changes, so that I can see real-time updates without manual refreshing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a watched file is modified externally THEN the system SHALL automatically reload the database within 2 seconds
2. WHEN file watching is active THEN the system SHALL display a clear "watching" indicator in the header
3. WHEN a watched file is deleted THEN the system SHALL notify the user and gracefully handle the missing file
4. WHEN file watching fails to start THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue without watching functionality
5. IF file watching encounters repeated errors THEN the system SHALL disable watching and notify the user

### Requirement 4: UI Responsiveness and Performance

**User Story:** As a user interacting with large SQLite databases, I want the interface to remain responsive during operations, so that I can continue working without delays or freezing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading a large database file THEN the system SHALL show a progress indicator and remain responsive
2. WHEN parsing database pages THEN the system SHALL process pages in batches to avoid blocking the UI
3. WHEN switching between pages THEN the sidebar SHALL update within 100ms without blocking other interactions
4. WHEN the database contains thousands of pages THEN the page grid SHALL render efficiently using virtualization if needed
5. IF parsing takes longer than 5 seconds THEN the system SHALL allow the user to cancel the operation

### Requirement 5: Status Messages and User Feedback

**User Story:** As a user performing operations in the SQLite browser, I want clear status messages and feedback, so that I understand what the system is doing and when operations complete.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any file operation begins THEN the system SHALL display an appropriate status message
2. WHEN operations complete successfully THEN the system SHALL show a brief success message that auto-dismisses after 3 seconds
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display persistent error messages with dismiss options
4. WHEN multiple status messages are queued THEN the system SHALL show them in sequence without overlap
5. IF a status message is critical THEN the system SHALL require user acknowledgment before dismissing

### Requirement 6: Keyboard Navigation and Accessibility

**User Story:** As a user who prefers keyboard navigation, I want to navigate the SQLite browser using keyboard shortcuts, so that I can work efficiently without relying solely on mouse interactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application has focus THEN the system SHALL support arrow key navigation through the page grid
2. WHEN a page is selected via keyboard THEN the system SHALL provide the same functionality as mouse selection
3. WHEN using Tab navigation THEN the system SHALL follow a logical focus order through all interactive elements
4. WHEN keyboard shortcuts are pressed THEN the system SHALL execute the corresponding actions (Ctrl+O for open, F5 for refresh)
5. IF focus is lost during navigation THEN the system SHALL restore focus to the last selected element when the window regains focus

### Requirement 7: Memory Management and Resource Cleanup

**User Story:** As a user working with multiple large SQLite files over time, I want the application to manage memory efficiently, so that performance doesn't degrade during extended use.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN closing a database file THEN the system SHALL properly release all associated memory and resources
2. WHEN switching between files THEN the system SHALL clean up resources from the previous file
3. WHEN file watching is stopped THEN the system SHALL properly dispose of file system watchers
4. WHEN the application is idle THEN the system SHALL maintain minimal memory footprint
5. IF memory usage exceeds reasonable limits THEN the system SHALL implement garbage collection strategies
